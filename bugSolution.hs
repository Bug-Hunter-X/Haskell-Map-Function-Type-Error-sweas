The issue lies in the function `processList`.  It's expecting a list as input, but the `map` function provides individual elements. The solution involves changing `processList` to accept a single element and modify the `main` function to correctly apply the map function.

```haskell
-- bug.hs
processList :: [[a]] -> [[a]]
processList xs = map (
    x -> [x]) xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let myList = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    print (processList myList)
```
```haskell
-- bugSolution.hs
processList :: [a] -> [a]
processList xs = xs -- or any other single element processing function

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    print (map processList [myList])
```
